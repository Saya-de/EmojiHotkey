# EmojiHotkey


This is a small VRChat Mod where you can use your Mouse3 Button (Pressing the Middle Button) to send an chosen Emoji. You need [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/releases/tag/updates-2021-12-30) to choose an Emoji from a list in the UIExpansionKit-Settings. You can choose between all 56 Emojis and your last choice is being saved for when starting the game for the next time.
Just download the latest Release of EmojiHotkey and of UIExpansionKit and put both of the .dllÂ´s in your Mods folder.
