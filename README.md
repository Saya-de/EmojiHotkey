# EmojiHotkey

This is a small Mod where you can use your Mouse3 Button (Pressing the Middle Button) to send an chosen Emoji. You need [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/releases/tag/updates-2021-12-30) to choose an Emoji from a list in the UIExpansionKit-Settings. You can choose between all 56 Emojis and your last choice is being saved when starting the game for the next time.
